kopala
======

JavaScript remote frontend for scala/java apps; the word 'kopala' means 'shovel' in Hawaiian; it is also a Georgian demigod that threw stones.

*This project is closed*

There is no reason to develop in Scala a scripting mechanism that uses JavaScript. Scala has a pretty good REPL, and this REPL should be used.
If I ever return to this problem, I'll be using Scala REPL instead (with the same transport options as in kopala)
